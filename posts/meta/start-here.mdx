This site provides analysis of the impact of technology on Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) when it comes to moving money around.

OTAs are increasingly recognizing the advantages of internalizing their fintech needs, and are developing in-house the
technology to manage their financial risks, leveraging the improvements in software and cloud computing. In doing so,
they are encroaching on the realm of their financial providers, instead of outsourcing their fintech needs to third party
providers. Rather than choosing to integrate with open banking solutions, they are doing away with financial institutions
and proactively building the tools themselves, including payment acceptance, lending, or fraud prevention.

I call this the **financialization of Online Travel Agencies**.

No other industry has such a pressing need to absorb payment industry capabilities as OTAs do. They are, like credit card
networks, in the business of intermediate between their customers and airlines, taking a fee in the process.
These companies are _global by design_, because they rely on economies of scale to maximize their profitability;
they thus serve a globally diverse customer base, and _strategically aim at accepting as many payment methods as they possibly can_;
and because they operate with such volumes and thin margins, they are forced to _be extremely vigilant to fraud risk_.

Unsurprisingly, it is absurd for OTAs to adopt *open banking*. They much rather adapt the patterns of financing high-value
sales such as cars or real state, into lower-value purchases like airline tickets and hotel reservations.

This financialization manifests itself in many ways, including:

- **Owning the Merchant-of-Record payment chain**: OTAs extend their already massive customer support operations to now
  include refunds, installments and gift cards.

- **Agility in Payment Method Acceptance**: The question is not "how many?" but "how flexibly can I accept more?", as alternative payment
  methods emerge and the landscape evolves.

- **Independent Fraud underwriting**: As they mature and grow, they are exposed to a scale of business transactions that
  make them better equipped to assess fraud risk and create their own _internal risk scores_, reducing their dependency
  on card schemes and fraud service providers.

- **Internal Currency Exchange Matching**: Rather than relying on exchange providers, who match currency buyers and sellers on the global
  markets, they are beginning to roll out their own matching engines in order to absorb what used to be a highly lucrative
  branch of banking.

- **Virtual Account Number programmes**: Streamlining the use of virtual credit cards for a cost effective and highly
  observable payment reconciliation process, that happens not at the issuing bank, but internally as well.

As a consequence, fintech departments within OTAs are transitioning from being perceived as a cost center to being recognized
as strategically important. I believe that the larger the OTA is, the greater the impact on the bottom line will come
from owning the payment experience, and if you do too, then you will enjoy my investigation on this topic.
