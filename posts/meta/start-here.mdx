This site provides analysis of the impact of technology on online travel agencies when it comes to moving money around.
They no longer sit on their hands and let others handle their financial risks, and, enabled by the tidal wave of software
and cloud computing, are eating away at banks' business, building services or products that were traditionally offered
by financial institutions, such as payment acceptance, lending, or fraud assessment, in-house.

I call this the **financialization of Online Travel Agencies**.

No other industry has such a pressing need to absorb payment processing capabilities as OTAs do. Their business is,
like credit cards, to position themselves between their customers and airlines, taking a fee in the process.
These companies are _global by design_, because their main value proposition comes from their resulting economies of scale; they thus
serve a globally diverse customer base, and _strategically aim at accepting as many payment methods as they possibly can_;
and because they operate with such volumes and thin margins, they are forced to _be extremely vigilant to fraud risk_.

Because of this, OTAs are adopting finance capabilities that aren't typically considered by other merchants, with the
possible exception of car manufacturers. Disruption doesn't happen because of radical technological changes, but rather
from adapting the lessons learned in financing high-value sales such as cars or real state, to lower-value purchases like
airline tickets and hotel reservations.

This financialization manifests itself in many ways, including:

- **Owning the Merchant-of-Record payment chain**: where OTAs extend their already massive customer support operations to now
  include refunds, installments and gift cards.

- **Payment Method Acceptance**: The question is not "how many?" but "how fast can I accept more", even as alternative payment
  methods emerge and the landscape evolves.

- **Fraud underwriting**: The idea that OTAs, as they mature and grow, are exposed to a scale of business transactions that
  make them better equipped to assess fraud risk and create their own _internal risk scores_, reducing their dependency
  on card schemes and fraud service providers.

- **Currency Exchange Matching**: Rather than relying on exchange providers, who match currency buyers and sellers on the global
  markets, they are beginning to roll out their own matching engines in order to absorb what used to be a highly lucrative
  branch of banking.

- **Virtual Account Number programmes**: Streamlining the use of virtual credit cards for a cost effective and highly
  observable payment reconciliation process, that happens not at the issuing bank, but internally as well.

As a consequence, fintech departments within OTAs are transitioning from being perceived as a cost to being recognized
as strategically important. I believe that the larger the OTA is, the greater the impact on the bottom line will come
from owning the payment experience, and if you do too, then you will enjoy my investigation on this topic.
